# Python dependencies for Memory Extraction & Personality Engine
# This project uses only standard library modules, so no external dependencies are required.

# However, if you want to enhance the project with NLP libraries, you could add:
# nltk>=3.8.1
# spacy>=3.5.0
# textblob>=0.17.1

# For now, the project works with Python 3.7+ standard library only.
